# Daily Code Challenge

## linked list
*Author: Odeh Abuzaid*

---

### Problem Domain
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

---

### Inputs and Expected Outputs

example :
```py
arr = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
iter_values = LinkedList(arr)

print(iter_values) # {1} -> {2} -> {3} -> {4} -> {5} -> Null
```

extended :
```py
# list head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> X

linkedList.append(5)

# head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> [5] -> X

# head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> X
linkedList.insert_before(3, 5)

# head -> [1] -> [5] -> [3] -> [2] -> X

# ...
```
